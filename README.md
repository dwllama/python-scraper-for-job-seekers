A good friend of mine has been out of work for the better part of a year. He had a long list of employers he wanted to work for and I wanted to help him find roles at his dream employers using a simple web scraper to scale his methods
instead of him reying on manually checking the career pages of 50+ URLs every day

This scraper was built for the non-technical user to run a simple script via CLI to scrape the career pages of specific companies for desired key terms (job roles) and outputs a CSV of the companies that show current openings
for these roles

This script currently has to be run via CLI each time to obtain a csv output of the results, but can be scheduled to run at a specific time each day automatically. (I am happy to help those that would like to accomplish this)
